# Plan 2.3 Summary

## Objective Met
Built an interim fake IoT glove generator to unblock PC Hub development logic while hardware is being wired.

## Actions Taken
- Implemented `scripts/simulate_glove.py` which hosts a standalone python websocket streaming random fluctuating mock sensor values on port 81 (mimicking the ESP8266 exactly).
- Hooked `select.select()` on the STDIN to read user console input for dynamically swapping mock gestures like `open`, `fist`, `point`, and `peace` mid-stream.
- Allows user spoofing heart-rate using `hr 85` via STDIN.

## Verification
- Code successfully compiled (`python -m py_compile scripts/simulate_glove.py` validated).
- Outputs the identical CSV data structure `<F1..HR>` expected by the Hub.
