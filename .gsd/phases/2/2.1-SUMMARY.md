# Plan 2.1 Summary

## Objective Met
Created the comprehensive wiring documentation for the split-brain IoT Glove architecture.

## Actions Taken
- Mapped 5 Flex sensors to analog pins (A0-A3, A6).
- Mapped Pulse Sensor to analog pin A7.
- Defined I2C connections (A4/A5) for MPU6050.
- Specified the Voltage Divider circuit allowing 5V Arduino TX to safely communicate with 3.3V ESP8266 RX.

## Verification
- Wiring guide specifies all required component connections.
- Pin conflicts were resolved by explicitly requiring an Arduino Nano to access A6/A7 pins, freeing A4/A5 for I2C.
