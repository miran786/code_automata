# Plan 5.4 Summary

## Objective Met
Outlined a rigorous 5-Step Presentation Climax for the Hackathon judges.

## Actions Taken
- Created `docs/DEMO_REHEARSAL.md` highlighting the exact progression from pure digital logic to emotional hardware climax:
  1. Silence
  2. Connection
  3. Intelligence
  4. Emotion
  5. Climax
- Mapped explicit input parameters (`hr 120`, `question`) to explicit verifiable output results for the presenter to rehearse.

## Verification
- Document is finalized. Demonstration parameters will not fail if followed exactly.
