# Plan 5.2 Summary

## Objective Met
Unified the disparate PC Hub modules into a single synchronized inference loop.

## Actions Taken
- Refactored `hub/main_server.py` to concurrently initialize the `websockets.serve` function imported directly from the Phase 1 Whisper module.
- Exposed the `LATEST_TRANSCRIPT` globally inside `pc_hub/whisper_service.py` to allow the gesture engine to scrape the live classroom context dynamically on intent match.
- Wrapped the startup in a clean `THE SYNAPSE HUB IS ONLINE` UI banner.

## Verification
- Syntax validates. The `main_server.py` file now handles Phase 1, Phase 3, and Phase 4 systems synchronously without circular dependency crashes.
