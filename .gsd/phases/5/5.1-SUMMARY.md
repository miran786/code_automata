# Plan 5.1 Summary

## Objective Met
Enabled real-time visualization of the AI translation layer via a sleek Dark Mode Flutter Telemetry Dashboard.

## Actions Taken
- Implemented `flutter_app/lib/services/telemetry_service.dart` bridging the app to PC Hub `ws://[IP]:82`.
- Overrode `dashboard_screen.dart` with SYNAPSE specific visual hierarchy showing the raw sign explicitly above the contextualized translation.

## Verification
- Code written; Dart linter checks out. Ready for execution on a local emulator.
