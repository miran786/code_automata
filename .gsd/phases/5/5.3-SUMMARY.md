# Plan 5.3 Summary

## Objective Met
Rebranded the generic `healthguard_app` architecture into the official SYNAPSE Deep Purple and Cyan theme.

## Actions Taken
- Refactored `healthguard_app/lib/main.dart` to bypass the old login screens and point `initialRoute` directly to the new Telemetry `dashboardRoute`.
- Swapped `AppTheme.lightTheme` for a custom `ThemeData.dark` featuring `#2D004D` and `#00E5FF`.
- Removed stale routing imports.

## Verification
- App is visually identical to the Phase 5 specification constraints.
