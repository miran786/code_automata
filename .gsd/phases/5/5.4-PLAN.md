# Plan 5.4: Demo Rehearsal (5-Step Climax)

## Objective
Create the script and verification checklist for the Hackathon judges to ensure the Bio-Digital Larynx proves its functionality seamlessly under pressure.

## Context
- .gsd/SPEC.md
- hardware/wiring_guide.md

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Draft Hackathon Demo Flow</name>
  <files>docs/DEMO_REHEARSAL.md</files>
  <action>
    - Create a markdown checklist.
    - **Step 1: The Silence.** Show the Glove. Show the App. Demonstrate the raw numbers coming in via `simulate_glove.py` or the ESP8266 serial.
    - **Step 2: The Connection.** Execute `main_server.py`. Demonstrate the App UI WebSocket lighting up and receiving the connection.
    - **Step 3: The Intelligence.** (Gesture -> Intent). Form the `question` gesture (or type it in the mock script). Watch the App instantly display `[ SIGN DETECTED: QUESTION ]`.
    - **Step 4: The Emotion.** (Heart Rate -> Pitch). With Heart Rate set to 75, hear the system say the Ollama output at normal speed. Then, type `hr 120` to spike the heart rate, form `question` again, and hear the system speak *faster*.
    - **Step 5: The Climax.** (Bone Conduction). Hand the 8Ω transducer to the judge. Have them press it to their cheekbone. Have the Glove sign "Yes, it works", and let them feel the voice in their skull.
